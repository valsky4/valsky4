👋 Hi, World — I'm Valsky4

I’m a Lead QA Automation Engineer passionate about building smart, scalable, and future-proof automation ecosystems. Since 2013, I’ve been driving strategic automation initiatives — transforming complex systems into maintainable, data-driven, and insight-rich frameworks.

🚀 What I Do

Automation Leadership: I define automation strategy, mentor teams, and align testing goals with business objectives to accelerate product delivery.

Framework Engineering: I design and implement end-to-end test architectures that blend Playwright, Pytest, and BDD for seamless cross-layer testing (frontend + API).

Intelligent Tools: Currently integrating Claude Code, MCP (Model Context Protocol), and other AI coding assistants to accelerate test generation, improve readability, and introduce adaptive automation patterns.

Frontend Automation: I focus on Playwright-based UI frameworks and hybrid test designs that cover real-world user journeys with traceability, stability, and maintainability in mind.

Continuous Delivery: Building automation pipelines that integrate deeply with CI/CD systems — ensuring test visibility, reliability, and auto-healing mechanisms for flaky tests.

🧠 What I’m Exploring

MCP (Model Context Protocol): Creating context-aware test systems that adapt dynamically to environment and data conditions.

Claude Code & AI Agents: Leveraging AI-assisted coding for test reasoning, scenario creation, and live debugging.

Cybersecurity: Expanding into automation for security validation, vulnerability detection, and threat modeling.

🧩 My Current Stack

Languages: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript

Frameworks: Playwright, Pytest, pytest-bdd

Tools: Docker, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Jira / Jira API

AI Assistants: Claude Code, MCP agents, Copilot (experimental - not a big fan)

Focus Areas: API automations, Frontend automations, system integration testing, test data management, and scalable test architecture.

🧭 Philosophy

Automation isn’t just about speed — it’s about building confidence in every release.
I believe in writing clean, maintainable, and self-documenting automation that bridges the gap between QA, development, and business.
